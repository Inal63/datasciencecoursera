##write a function named 'pollutantmean' that claculates the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors.

  pollutant <- c("sulfate", "nitrate") ##not sure what goes in here either yet") ## where sulfate or nitrate are calculated
    mean(id("pollutant", rm.na = TRUE)/id
